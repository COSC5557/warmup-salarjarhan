I used linear regression to predict the quality of red wine. After
fitting the model, I tried to predict and compare results for both train
and test sets to avoid the over fitting. The following plot shows the
actual vs predicted Wine Quality for test set.

``` r
# Plot the Actual and Predicted Wine Quality for test dataset
ggplot(data = test_data, aes(x = quality, y = prediction_test)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Actual Quality", y = "Predicted Quality") +
  ggtitle(paste("Actual vs. Predicted Wine Quality (RMSE =", round(rmse_test, 2), ")"))
```

## 10-fold cross-validation

Here, I used 10-fold CV for the problem above to compare the results
which are close to each other.

``` r
# Perform 10-fold cross-validation
num_folds <- 10
cv_results <- train(quality ~ ., data = train_data, method = "lm", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = num_folds))
cv_rmse <- cv_results$results$RMSE

prediction_test_cv <- predict(cv_results, newdata = test_data)
rmse_test_cv <- sqrt(mean((test_data$quality - prediction_test_cv)^2))

print(paste("Model Performance using 10-fold cross-validation RMSE =", cv_rmse))
```

``` r
print(paste("Prediction Quality for test set using 10-fold cross-validation RMSE =", rmse_test_cv))

# Classification

For classification problem, I am using a threshold to classify the wine
quality as “high” and “low” which would turn the problem to binary
classification. Knn would then be used to train the model and accuracy
of the model be evaluated by confusion matrix for both training and
testing sets.

``` r
# Define a quality threshold to classify as "high" or "low" quality
quality_threshold <- 6  

# Create a binary classification target variable
train_data$class <- ifelse(train_data$quality >= quality_threshold, "High Quality", "Low Quality")
test_data$class <- ifelse(test_data$quality >= quality_threshold, "High Quality", "Low Quality")

# Create a classification model (random forest)
c_model <- train(class ~ ., data = train_data, method = "knn")

# Evaluate the classification model for train set
predictions_train <- predict(c_model, newdata = train_data)
confusion_matrix_train <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(train_data$class), as.factor(predictions_train))
print(paste("confusion matrix for train data"))
```

Based on the results, accuracy of predictions using train and test sets
are slightly different. The predictions using train set has better
accuracy with 0.80 in comparison to the test set with accuracy of 0.74.
Seems that model is over fitted here, however, we can investigate more
about the model by changing the quality threshold (quality_threshold \<-
6) and split size of the data (p = 0.7).
